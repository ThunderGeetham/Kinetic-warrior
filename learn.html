            It all started when a 11 year old boy kept on forgeting his pencil to school everyday and had to borrow one
            from his friends.<br>
            Even though he had a pencil, he hated it as he had to switch between pen and pencil every 10 seconds.<br>
            So one day he got an idea of making a 2 in 1(pen + pencil) pen with some useless pen caps, broken pencil and
            a pen and made the WARRIOR.<br>
            It was also good in PenFights(WWE of pens).<br>
            One day his friend loved the pen so much that he partnered up with him and added an eraser.<br>
            After few days, they made two companies called KINETIC and Shinobi.<br>
            Kinetic created the pens and Shinobi marketed and sold'em.<br>
            They started selling them in school and it was pretty good.<br>
            Now they are selling nationaly in India.<br>
            As you read this, a new model is being designed and made by KINETIC.<br>
